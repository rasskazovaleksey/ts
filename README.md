## Transactional key value store.

TODO: add:

- overview with video
- how to build for every platform
- system design from draw.io
- tech stack list
- project structure table
- commit history with explanations table
- improvements: 1) split `versions.tolm` into to files so composite build of build build
  conventions will have it's own versions, 2) better naming for targets to avoid code replication
  and sync not on object. 3) in TransactionalKeyValueStore lock can be implemented to transactions
  not to this.
